      <h5 class="card-title" style="color: cyan;">Bluetooth Control</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Bluetooth works by the simple principle
        of sending and receiving data in the
        form of radio waves. Every Bluetooth
        enabled device has a card-like
        attachment known as the Bluetooth
        adapter. It is this Bluetooth adapter that
        sends and receives data.
        We made a Bluetooth controlled robot
        car which was easy to operate using a
        mobile application. It’s simple in making
        and easy to understand. Its the kind of
        basics of robotics that every student
        above certain age must know.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title" style="color: cyan;">Obstacle Avoiding</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Obstacle avoiding is a concept
        used in the tesla self driving car
        which detects any human, vehicle
        or any obstacle in its proximity
        and changes the path of the
        vehicle to avoid collision.
        This concept is one of the
        defining pillars of the self driving
        car.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title" style="color: cyan;">Line Following Bot</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Line following is based on the automated concept of following a path, using IR sensors. This
        is also one of the technology used in Tesla cars. Where the vehicle follows the particular path it is dedicated
        to. The code of the program plays an important role here.</p>

            where layers of
            materials are fused together in a pattern to create an object. The material is usually melted just past its
            glass transition temperature, and then extruded in a pattern next to or on top of previous extrusions,
            creating an object layer by layer.</h3>
