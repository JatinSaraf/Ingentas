        <h2></h2>
        <p>
          <h1 style="color: whitesmoke;">We are a robotic education firm based in Hyderabad comprising
            of Engineers from various fileds who have expertise in the field of
            Robotic.
            Collectively, our team has done 15+ major robotics projects.
            We have been hosting workshops from past 6-7 months under a
            different banner.
            We aim to impart knowledge about robotics to bright and young
            minds. as robotics and Automation is a field which will touch their
            lives directly or indirectly at some poin. Be it from basic Alexa and
            Google Home Mini to large automated AI refrigerators. </h1>
        </p>
        <h1 class="section-title">What We Do?</h1>
        <p>
          <h1 style="color: whitesmoke;">
            Our vision as stated above is to impart robotics to students
            at a young age. Hence, we have broken down the extreme
            neurological roboticsproject into simple pieces or simple
            puzzles to be precise.
            Students will get a very clear understanding of what
            robotics is and how it can be implemented in daily life
            products
            We also aim to nurture the creativ of students in different
            way. Students who come up with new ideas will be
            rewarded accordingly.
            we are very clear in our vision and have a proper disciplined
            and oriented team to perform this task

      <h5 class="card-title" style="color: cyan;">Bluetooth Control</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Bluetooth works by the simple principle
        of sending and receiving data in the
        form of radio waves. Every Bluetooth
        enabled device has a card-like
        attachment known as the Bluetooth
        adapter. It is this Bluetooth adapter that
        sends and receives data.
        We made a Bluetooth controlled robot
        car which was easy to operate using a
        mobile application. It’s simple in making
        and easy to understand. Its the kind of
        basics of robotics that every student
        above certain age must know.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title" style="color: cyan;">Obstacle Avoiding</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Obstacle avoiding is a concept
        used in the tesla self driving car
        which detects any human, vehicle
        or any obstacle in its proximity
        and changes the path of the
        vehicle to avoid collision.
        This concept is one of the
        defining pillars of the self driving
        car.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title" style="color: cyan;">Line Following Bot</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Line following is based on the automated concept of following a path, using IR sensors. This is also one of the technology used in Tesla cars. Where the vehicle follows the particular path it is dedicated to. The code of the program plays an important role here.</p>

            glass transition temperature, and then extruded in a pattern next to or on top of previous extrusions,
            creating an object layer by layer.</h3>
